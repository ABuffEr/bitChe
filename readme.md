# Bit Che #
*	 Authors: Alberto Zanella, Alberto Buffolino.
*	 download [version 1.1][1]

This add-on improves the accessibility of Bit Che. It adds the following features:

- Makes accessible the search results list: you will need to use objects navigation if the addon is not installed.
- Allows to use Applications key to activate the context menu on the focused result, since this can only be performed with mouse commands.

## Notes ##
*	 You can use up and down arrow keys to focus the result on you want to interact
*	 When the first search after starting Bit Che is finished, the first result will be focused, though it may not be selected properly. NVDA will speak the selected result. Use the usual commands or the previous procedure to perform actions on the current results list.
## Changes for 1.1 ##
*	 Added customized classes for results list and items.

## Changes for 1.0 ##
*	 Initial version.
